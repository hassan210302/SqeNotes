# Modular Architecture 
# Important points about Three Tier Architecture
 - Three layers 
   - Presentation Layer
   - Buisness Layer
   - Data Layer

## Benefits
  - Independent Modules

## Web Development Usage
 - Front End Layer
  - It consists of front end server having static content and some dynamic content using cache. 
 - Middle Layer
  - It consists of processing layer. For example Spring, Asp.net, Rails
 - Data Layer 
  - It consists of data processing layer and Database such as MySql
  
## Difference Between layers and Tiers
- Tiers Depends on physical distribution
- Layers Depends on logical distribution
 - For Example, Our middle tier which consists of our buisness layer consists of different classes. We can call these classes layers. All these Layers are on the middle Tier.
